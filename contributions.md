|9|N| | | Discussion of GHG concentrations and aerosols. Changes from PMIP3|
|10|N| | | Discussion of land cover specifications. State variety of ways to encode into GCMs. Role of dynamic veg (relate back to piControl specifications and DECK).|
|11|Y|Chris | | Introduce CMIP6 and DECK. Data available for download on ESGF. PMIP4 simulations are open to non-CMIP6 models, process for securing data not as obvious.|
|12|Y|Chris | | Describe some basic ensemble features of PMIP4. Refer to Table \ref{tab:gcms}. Specify inclusion criteria.|
|13|Y|Chris | | Brief discussion of PMIP3 - stress no individual models identified here, so reference previous papers for that info|
|14|Y|Chris | | Explain issue with calendar changes. Stress often not adjusted for in previous studies.|
|15|Y|Chris| Patrick Bartlein? | introduce PaleoCalAdjust software.|
|16|Y| Anni Zhao | | describe treatment of calendar adjustments in this paper, and highlight potential implications.|
|17|Y|Chris | | Introduce CVDP. Highlight settings. Note all output data available to researchers, but only smattering shown in this papers. Rest for subsequent papers.|
|18|Y|Chris | | Monsoon domain definition. How treating calendar adjustment in this component. highlight differences to standard defintion, to better fit paleoruns/variability. Code available...|
|19|X|Removed (duplicated Para.48) | | How calculate variables for data-model comparison - MTCO, MTWA, but mainly pseudocorals.|
|20|Y|Chris | | Bland introductory paragraph saying what is to come in this section, and that it is important.|
|ME1|Y|Chris | | Highlight that models are not perfect and can have biases in their climate representation. Describe large-scale features and common issues shown in Fig. \ref{fig:piControl_evaluation}.|
|Para.ME2|Y|Chris | | Mention the comparison above is w.r.t. modern/satellite patterns. piControl is perpetual 1850, and roughly 1\textdegree C warming since then. So compare with earlier data - only really reliable within broad zones. Explain features in Fig. \ref{fig:pi_latbands}.|
|21|Y|Chris | | Describe large-scale features - interhemispheric gradient etc from Fig. \ref{fig:tempdiff}. Compare to expected result from insolation forcings|
|22|Y|Chris | | Describe dominant seasonality changes from Fig. \ref{fig:tempdiff}.|
|23|Y|Chris | | Discuss ensemble consistency. Look at spread between GCMs. Say where high and low.|
|24|Y|Chris | | Describe the differences between the PMIP generations by looking at the Fig. \ref{fig:tempdiff}|
|25|Y|Chris | | Significance - we don't plan to calculate this statistically (not sure of robust stats method with these small, non-normal ensembles), but by comparing images we should speculate of the importance of any differences.|
|26|Y|Chris | | Describe large-scale features - ITCZ shift etc from Fig. \ref{fig:rainfall}. Compare to expected result from insolation forcings|
|27|X|removed | | Describe dominant seasonality changes from Fig. \ref{fig:rainfall}.|

|30|Y|Chris | | Significance - we don't plan to calculate this statistically (not sure of robust stats methid with these small, non-normal ensembles), but by comparing images we should speculate of the importance of any differences.|
|31|Y| Roberta D'Agostino | | Description of what the global monsoon domain actually is|
|32|N| Roberta D'Agostino | | What do the models suggest for midHolocene changes in the global monsoon domain (Fig. \ref{fig:globalmonsoon})? |
|33|N| | | Describe changes in North African monsoon domain. Explain different metrics - expansion of area, average pr rate (Fig. \ref{fig:individualmonsoons})? |
|34|N| | | Describe changes in Asian monsoon domains. Compare PMIP4 to PMIP3|
|35|N| | | Describe changes other monsoons (S. Amer, N. Amer, AUSMC, S. African). Compare PMIP4 to PMIP3|
|36|Y| Xiaoxu Shi | | Brief description of (reconstructed) ocean changes at midHolocene - small variations in sea level, SSTs follow SAT (so already discussed), thoughts about AMOC reconstruction.|
|37|Y|Chris | | Description of changes in AMOC using Fig. \ref{fig:amoc}. They seem fairly non-existent so far)|
|38|N| Charlie Williams | | Sum up the results from the PMIP4 simulations. Mainly just repeat what's above.|
|39|N| | | Provide an overview of PMIP4 vs PMIP3. Conclude by commenting on whether we can treat both as a combined ensemble, or if fundamentally different.|
|40|N| | | Intro paragraph outlining benefits of DMC, and its potential uses. Shout back to previous efforts.|
|41|Y| Darrell Kaufmann | | Describe the various mechanisms by which temperature can be reconstructed. Describe new data compilation coordinated by N. Arizona.|
|42|Y| Chris | | Compare the latitudinal reconstructed temperatures to simulated changes. Resulting in something looking like Fig. \ref{fig:DTlatbands}.|
|43|N| | | Introduce pollen reconstructions of climate. Stress how can be used for multiple variables, adn mainstay of DMC in PMIP.|
|44|X| Removed | | Describe new Cleator et al reconstruction and data assimilation procedure. State how it compares to Bartlein et al. reconstruction (like in Fig. \ref{fig:CleatorvsBart}).|
|45|N| | | Describe update of AR5 Fig9.11d.|
|46|N| | | Culminate this DMC section via Taylor diagram. Show invidual models, for different variables. |
|47|N| ? | | Describe how we think ENSO was different during the midHolocene. Reference some papers. Introduce Emile-Geay et al (2015, Nature Geoscience) paper as the current compilation of paleoENSO|
|48|N| ? | | Describe pseudocoral method and advantages of using 'forward model' for DMC|
|49|N| Julien Emile-Geay | | Present and discuss comparison between PMIP4 ENSO, data and PMIP3. Will need a figure, perhaps something like Fig. \ref{fig:enso}|
|50|N| | | Provide and overarching summary of the data-model comparison. Provide preliminary answer as to whether PMIP4 is better that PMIP3. (I suspect it will be "In some cases, yes. In some places longstanding biases still exist though").|
|51|N| | | Make some recommendations about what datasets may be more informative in future. Basically just make a shout-out for upcoming data compilations. Comment on role of isotope enabled models (some here are, but we're not using that capacity) and forward proxy models.|
|52|N| | | Explain again what PMIP4 and its midHolocene simulation are|
|53|N| | | Summarise the model results shown in this paper. A sentence each on the various sections|temperatures, rainfall, monsoons, AMOC.|
|54|N| | | Summarise the data model comparison results. Say we have evaluated the models. Highlight possibility of formally bringing that evaluation through to projections with some past2future emergent constraint applications.|
